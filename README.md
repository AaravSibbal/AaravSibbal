### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My new project
  - zippy: zippy is a simple intuitive zipping cli made using Go, it was made to to make the zipping experience on windows better because sometime you ust need to get the job done

### What am I up to:
  - currently I am trying to make some cli's that I need, zippy was one but I have a couple more that I have panned.
