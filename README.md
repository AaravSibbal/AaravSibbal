### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - making my first ever production website for a Nails Technician Freelancer
  - I am using Go for the backend
  - Using Go templating library to avoid unnecessary complexity as I want it to be able to run without much maintenance
  - I am caching the html templates, images and the email regex at compile time to create robustness and also to have a faster experience (note: this only works as it is a static website and is pretty small)
  - Making a responsive UI according to the needs of my client
### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  - Testing in Go
  - How to implement CD with Digital Ocean
  - How to make responsive UI for both desktop and mobile
