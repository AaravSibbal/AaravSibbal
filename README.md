### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me:

I am a CS student. I use Vim extension in VSCode, git CLI, Obsidian, as Markdown is the only way BTW.

### My new projects

- Squash Discord Bot: I created a discord bot for Carleton University Squash Club as I realized the need for it being a member and having conversations. It's purpose is for people to have a place to see their progress through Elo which is a concept I picked up from chess. 
- Squash Website: Having access to the data, I wanted the members to be able to view their stats without always messaging on Discord, and also wanted them to view their data with more detail. Thus I created a website where players can track their rankings, view all their matches and stats.
- Portfolio:  I have finished my portfolio website, it is made using Go as the server. Used "tmpl" for the rendering, still need to add the CSS. Hosted it on digital ocean using their app service. Check it out at aaravsibbal.com 
- zippy: zippy is a simple intuitive zipping CLI made using Go, it was made to make the zipping experience on windows better because sometime you just need to get the job done.
